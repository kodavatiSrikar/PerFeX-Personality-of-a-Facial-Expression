# Dataset-for-facial-expression-of-personality


## Overview

Briefly describe the purpose of the project and what the dataset is used for.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing. The dataset can be generated using two models that are provided in the project.

### Prerequisites

2. Download the folder, unzip the files inside, and copy the files into the project directory.

## Usage

Follow the below sections to train and run the inference of the models. 

## [Note]

Inference of the model can be executed without training the model. The pre-trained weights for both models are provided in the google drive.


## Multi-scale CNN

## Training

Run the following in the project directory to train the model

```bash
python 1dcnn_train.py
```
